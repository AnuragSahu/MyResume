My RESUME
==============

Hey There folks,
I was just staking one of my seniors at collage through github ;P and saw the resume on his website. It was a very organised and a resume with many feathers on his hat, <br>
Shivam Khandewal [https://github.com/skbly7].<br>
<br>
I searched about TeX and found out that is a very good markup language specially if you are looking for resumes. And found out that the resume templete was made by Debarghya Das [https://github.com/deedy]. He is an software engineer at Facebook.<br>

I really liked the resume template, so I put on my resume on top of it.<br>
